# Yellow RAT Lab

## Objective
Investigate malware behind abnormal network traffic at GlobalTech Industries

### Category: 
Threat Intel

### Tools: 
VirusTotal

### Scenario:
During a regular IT security check at GlobalTech Industries, abnormal network traffic was detected from multiple workstations. Upon initial investigation, it was discovered that certain employees' search queries were being redirected to unfamiliar websites. This discovery raised concerns and prompted a more thorough investigation. Your task is to investigate this incident and gather as much information as possible.

Known IOC : SHA256 hash:
30E527E45F50D2BA82865C5679A6FA998EE0A1755361AB01673950810D071C85

### Steps:
1. Understanding the adversary helps defend against attacks. What is the name of the malware family that causes abnormal network traffic? PoshC2 - S0378, Jupyter Loader, Jupyter Client, "Yellow Cockatoo RAT"
